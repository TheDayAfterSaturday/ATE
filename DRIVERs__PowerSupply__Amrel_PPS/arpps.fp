The driver contains all the functions that IVI and VXIplug&play require.  In addition, the driver contains high-level functions that configure the power supply and generate output in a single operation.  The driver also contains lower level functions that configure the power supply and initiate the output changes in separate operations.   

Note:  This driver requires the VISA and IVI libraries.  
     �    This class contains functions that configure the instrument.  The class includes high-level functions that configure multiple instrument settings as well as low-level functions that set, get, and check individual attribute values.

    _    This class contains functions and sub-classes that control common instrument operations.  These functions include many of functions that VXIplug&play require, such as reset, self-test, revision query, error query, and error message.  This class also contains functions that access IVI error infomation, lock the session, and perform instrument I/O.
     R    This class contains functions that retrieve and clear the IVI error information.     ?    This class contains functions that retrieve coercion records.     J    This class contains functions that retrieve interchangeability warnings.     k    This class contains functions that lock and unlock IVI instrument driver sessions for multithread safefy.     F    This class contains functions that send and receive instrument data.    =    This function performs the following initialization actions:

- Creates a new IVI instrument driver session.

- Opens a session to the specified device using the interface and address you specify for the Resource Name parameter.

- If the ID Query parameter is set to VI_TRUE, this function queries the instrument ID and checks that it is valid for this instrument driver.

- If the Reset parameter is set to VI_TRUE, this function resets the instrument to a known state.

- Sends initialization commands to set the instrument to the state necessary for the operation of the instrument driver.

- Returns a ViSession handle that you use to identify the instrument in all subsequent instrument driver function calls.

Note:  This function creates a new session each time you invoke it. Although you can open more than one IVI session for the same resource, it is best not to do so.  You can use the same session in multiple program threads.  You can use the arpps_LockSession and arpps_UnlockSession functions to protect sections of code that require exclusive access to the resource.

Valid Range:
VI_TRUE  (1) - Perform ID Query (Default Value)
VI_FALSE (0) - Skip ID Query

When you set this parameter to VI_TRUE, the driver verifies that the instrument you initialize is a type that this driver supports.  

Circumstances can arise where it is undesirable to send an ID Query command string to the instrument.  When you set this parameter to VI_FALSE, the function initializes the instrument without performing an ID Query.     �    Specify whether you want the to reset the instrument during the initialization procedure.

Valid Range:
VI_TRUE  (1) - Reset Device (Default Value)
VI_FALSE (0) - Don't Reset

    �    Returns a ViSession handle that you use to identify the instrument in all subsequent instrument driver function calls.

Notes:

(1) This function creates a new session each time you invoke it.  This is useful if you have multiple physical instances of the same type of instrument.  

(2) Avoid creating multiple concurrent sessions to the same physical instrument.  Although you can create more than one IVI session for the same resource, it is best not to do so.  A better approach is to use the same IVI session in multiple execution threads.  You can use functions arpps_LockSession and arpps_UnlockSession to protect sections of code that require exclusive access to the resource.

�    You can use this control to set the initial value of certain attributes for the session.  The following table lists the attributes and the name you use in this parameter to identify the attribute.

Name              Attribute Defined Constant   --------------------------------------------
RangeCheck        ARPPS_ATTR_RANGE_CHECK
QueryInstrStatus  ARPPS_ATTR_QUERY_INSTRUMENT_STATUS
Cache             ARPPS_ATTR_CACHE
Simulate          ARPPS_ATTR_SIMULATE
RecordCoercions   ARPPS_ATTR_RECORD_COERCIONS

The format of this string is, "AttributeName=Value" where AttributeName is the name of the attribute and Value is the value to which the attribute will be set.  To set multiple attributes, separate their assignments with a comma.

If you pass NULL or an empty string for this parameter and a VISA resource descriptor for the Resource Name parameter, the session uses the default values for the attributes. The default values for the attributes are shown below:

    Attribute Name     Default Value
    ----------------   -------------
    RangeCheck         VI_TRUE
    QueryInstrStatus   VI_TRUE
    Cache              VI_TRUE
    Simulate           VI_FALSE
    RecordCoercions    VI_FALSE

If you pass NULL or an empty string for this parameter and a virtual instrument or logical name for the Resource Name parameter, the session uses the values that you configure for virtual instrument or logical name with the IVI Configuration utility.

You can override the values of the attributes by assigning a value explicitly in a string you pass for this parameter.  You do not have to specify all of the attributes and may leave any of them out.  If you do not specify one of the attributes, its default value or the value that you configure with the IVI Configuration utility will be used.

The following are the valid values for ViBoolean attributes:

    True:     1, TRUE, or VI_TRUE
    False:    0, FALSE, or VI_FALSE

Default Value: "Simulate=0,RangeCheck=1,QueryInstrStatus=0,Cache=1"

Notes:
(1) For the DriverSetup parameter, you can pass the following strings:
  Model: X where X is the instrament type PPS8-10, PPS18-4, PPS30-2.5, PPS35-2, PPS60-10, PPS128-0.5, PPS250-0.2, PPS5-30, PPS35-3R, PPS60-1.5R, PPS8-6D, PPS18-4D, PPS35-2D, PPS30-3D, PPS60-1D, PPS128.05D, PPS30-6, PPS35-5, PPS8-20, PPS18-10, PPS60-3, PPS128-1.5

Here is an example of this option string which turns on simulation and emulates the PPS250-0.2:

  "Simulate=1,DriverSetup=Model:PPS250-0.2"
 
(2) If you enable IDQuery and don't pass DriverSetup driver automaticly detect your instrument model.

(3) If you don't pass these parameters and IDQuery is disabled default model is American Reliance PPS 35-2.    +� =   �  �    Resource Name                     0� : �       ID Query                          3} =� �       Reset Device                      47 �Y �  �    Instrument Handle                 6�#����  �    Status                          ����   P��                                           =� �  � �    Option String                      "GPIB::14::INSTR"   Yes VI_TRUE No VI_FALSE   Yes VI_TRUE No VI_FALSE    	           	           KCopyright 1999-2013 National Instruments Corporation.

This is a low-level function that you can use to set the values of instrument-specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than the value you specify. 

This instrument driver contains high-level functions that set most of the instrument attributes.  It is best to use the high-level driver functions as much as possible.  They handle order dependencies and multithread locking for you.  In addition, they perform status checking only after setting all of the attributes.  In contrast, when you set multiple attributes using the SetAttribute functions, the functions check the instrument status after each call.

Also, when state caching is enabled, the high-level functions that configure multiple attributes perform instrument I/O only for the attributes whose value you change.  Thus, you can safely call the high-level functions without the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

  hierarchical list of the available attributes.  Attributes 
  whose value cannot be set are dim.  Help text is shown for 
  each attribute.  Select an attribute by double-clicking on it  
  or by selecting it and then pressing <ENTER>.

  Read-only attributes appear dim in the list box.  If you 
  select a read-only attribute, an error message appears.

  A ring control at the top of the dialog box allows you to see 
  all IVI attributes or only the attributes of the ViInt32 type.   
  If you choose to see all IVI attributes, the data types appear
  to the right of the attribute names in the list box. 
  Attributes with data types other than ViInt32 are dim.  If
  you select an attribute data type that is dim, LabWindows/CVI
  transfers you to the function panel for the corresponding
  function that is consistent with the data type.

This is a low-level function that you can use to set the values of instrument-specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than the value you specify. 

This instrument driver contains high-level functions that set most of the instrument attributes.  It is best to use the high-level driver functions as much as possible.  They handle order dependencies and multithread locking for you.  In addition, they perform status checking only after setting all of the attributes.  In contrast, when you set multiple attributes using the SetAttribute functions, the functions check the instrument status after each call.

Also, when state caching is enabled, the high-level functions that configure multiple attributes perform instrument I/O only for the attributes whose value you change.  Thus, you can safely call the high-level functions without the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

You can use this function to get the values of instrument- specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes.  If the attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs instrument I/O in the following cases:

- State caching is disabled for the entire session or for the particular attribute.

- State caching is enabled and the currently cached value is invalid. 

You must provide a ViChar array to serve as a buffer for the value.  You pass the number of bytes in the buffer as the Buffer Size parameter.  If the current value of the attribute, including the terminating NUL byte, is larger than the size you indicate in the Buffer Size parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

If you want to call this function just to get the required buffer size, you can pass 0 for the Buffer Size and VI_NULL for the Attribute Value buffer.  

If you want the function to fill in the buffer regardless of the   number of bytes in the value, pass a negative number for the Buffer Size parameter.

A constant voltage condition occurs when the output voltage is equal to the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_VOLTAGE_LEVEL attribute and the current is less than or equal to the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT attribute.

A constant current condition occurs when the output current is equal to the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT attribute and the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT_BEHAVIOR attribute is set to ARPPS_VAL_CURRENT_REGULATE.

An unregulated condition occurs when the output voltage is less than the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_VOLTAGE_LEVEL attribute and the current is less than the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT attribute.

An over-voltage condition occurs when the output voltage is equal to or greater than the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_OVP_LIMIT attribute and the ARPPS_ATTR_OVP_ENABLED attribute is set to VI_TRUE.

An over-current condition occurs when the output current is equal to or greater than the value of the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT attribute and the ARPPS_ATTR_CURRENT_LIMIT_BEHAVIOR attribute is set to ARPPS_VAL_CURRENT_TRIP.  

When either an over-voltage condition or an over-current condition occurs, the power supply's output protection disables the output.  If the power supply is in an over-voltage or over-current state, it does not produce power until the output protection is reset.  The arpps_ResetOutputProtection function resets the output protection.  Once the output protection is reset, the power supply resumes generating a power signal.

If the current value of the return buffer, including the terminating NUL byte, is larger than the size you indicate in the Buffer Size parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value.  For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

One exception exists: If the BufferSize parameter is 0, the function does not clear the error information. By passing 0 for the buffer size, the caller can ascertain the buffer size required to get the entire error description string and then call the function again with a sufficiently large buffer.

If the user specifies a valid IVI session for the InstrumentHandle parameter, Get Error retrieves and then clears the error information for the session.  If the user passes VI_NULL for the InstrumentHandle parameter, this function retrieves and then clears the error information for the current execution thread.  If the InstrumentHandle parameter is an invalid session, the function does nothing and returns an error. Normally, the error information describes the first error that occurred since the user last called arpps_GetError or arpps_ClearError.

To do so requires ensuring that each test module completely configures the state of each instrument it uses.  If a particular test module does not completely configure the state of an instrument, the state of the instrument depends on the configuration from a previously executed test module.  If you execute the test modules in a different order, the behavior of the instrument and therefore the entire test module is likely to change.  This change in behavior is generally instrument specific and represents an interchangeability problem.

You can use this function to test for such cases.  After you call this function, the interchangeability checking algorithms in the specific driver ignore all previous configuration operations.  By calling this function at the beginning of a test module, you can determine whether the test module has dependencies on the operation of previously executed test modules.

This function does not clear the interchangeability warnings from the list of previously recorded interchangeability warnings.  If you want to guarantee that the arpps_GetNextInterchangeWarning function only returns those interchangeability warnings that are generated after calling this function, you must clear the list of interchangeability warnings.  You can clear the interchangeability warnings list by repeatedly calling the arpps_GetNextInterchangeWarning function until no more interchangeability warnings are returned.  If you are not interested in the content of those warnings, you can call the arpps_ClearInterchangeWarnings function.

Before it does so, it waits until all other execution threads have released their locks on the instrument session.

Other threads might have obtained a lock on this session in the following ways:

- The user's application called arpps_LockSession.

- A call to the instrument driver locked the session.

- A call to the IVI engine locked the session.

After your call to arpps_LockSession returns successfully, no other threads can access the instrument session until you call arpps_UnlockSession.

Use arpps_LockSession and arpps_UnlockSession around a sequence of calls to instrument driver functions if you require that the instrument retain its settings through the end of the sequence.

You can safely make nested calls to arpps_LockSession within the same thread.  To completely unlock the session, you must balance each call to arpps_LockSession with a call to arpps_UnlockSession.  If, however, you use the Caller Has Lock parameter in all calls to arpps_LockSession and arpps_UnlockSession within a function, the IVI Library locks the session only once within the function regardless of the number of calls you make to arpps_LockSession.  This allows you to call arpps_UnlockSession just once at the end of the function.

Default Value:  None
    �    This parameter serves as a convenience.  If you do not want to use this parameter, pass VI_NULL. 

Use this parameter in complex functions to keep track of whether you obtain a lock and therefore need to unlock the session.  Pass the address of a local ViBoolean variable.  In the declaration of the local variable, initialize it to VI_FALSE.  Pass the address of the same local variable to any other calls you make to arpps_LockSession or arpps_UnlockSession in the same function.

The parameter is an input/output parameter.  arpps_LockSession and arpps_UnlockSession each inspect the current value and take the following actions:

- If the value is VI_TRUE, arpps_LockSession does not lock the session again.  If the value is VI_FALSE, arpps_LockSession obtains the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_TRUE.

- If the value is VI_FALSE, arpps_UnlockSession does not attempt to unlock the session.  If the value is VI_TRUE, arpps_UnlockSession releases the lock and sets the value of the parameter to VI_FALSE.
 
Thus, you can, call arpps_UnlockSession at the end of your function without worrying about whether you actually have the lock.  

Example:

ViStatus TestFunc (ViSession vi, ViInt32 flags)
{
    ViStatus error = VI_SUCCESS;
    ViBoolean haveLock = VI_FALSE;

    if (flags & BIT_1)
        {
        viCheckErr( arpps_LockSession(vi, &haveLock));
        viCheckErr( TakeAction1(vi));
        if (flags & BIT_2)
            {
            viCheckErr( arpps_UnlockSession(vi, &haveLock));
            viCheckErr( TakeAction2(vi));
            viCheckErr( arpps_LockSession(vi, &haveLock);
            } 
        if (flags & BIT_3)
            viCheckErr( TakeAction3(vi));
