                                    ViReal64 extModSignalLevel,
                                    ViReal64 *valueToSetModul);

  Purpose

      Determines the Modulation level to be set for Depth(AM), Deviation(FM),
      or Deviation(PM) when the internal and external modulating sources are
      used with the selected modulation.

          Variable Type       ViInt16

          Select the Modulation for which to determine the modulation level
          when internal and external modulating signals are used.
          
          Valid Range:
          0 - Amplitude Modulation
          1 - Frequency Modulation
          2 - Phase Modulation
          
          Default Value: 0 - Amplitude Modulation

      desiredModulValue

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Indicates the desired depth or deviation for the specified
          modulation.
          
          Valid Range:   The range of this control is
                         dependent upon the selected
                         modulation.
          
                         AM:
                             0.0 - 100.0  (%)
                         FM:
                             0.0 - 100.0  (kHz)
                         PM:
                             0.0 - 10.0   (RAD)

          Note:  If the level of the external modulating
                 signal is equal to 0.5, this signal
                 provides 1/3 of the desired modulation
                 depth or deviation. If the level is less
                 than 0.5, this signal provides less than
                 1/3 of the desired depth or deviation.

                 D = Desired Modulation Level
                 E = External Source Level
                 S = Setting for the Modulation Level
          
                 If E = 0.5
                     S = 2/3 * D
          
                 If E < 0.5
                     S = D / (1 + E)

  Return Value

          This control contains the status code returned by the function call.

          Default Value:  "GPIB::19"
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Based on the Instrument Descriptor, this operation establishes a
          communication session with a device.  The grammar for the Instrument
          Descriptor is shown below.  Optional parameters are shown in square
          brackets ([]).
          
          Interface   Grammar

          GPIB        GPIB[board]::primary address[::secondary address]
                      [::INSTR]
          
          The GPIB keyword is used with GPIB instruments.
          
          The default value for optional parameters are shown below.
          
          Optional Parameter          Default Value

      IDQuery

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

          This control specifies if an ID Query is sent to the instrument
          during the initialization procedure.
          
          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Skip Query
          VI_ON  (1) - Do Query (Default Value)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Under normal circumstances the ID Query ensures that the
          instrument initialized is the type supported by this driver. However
          circumstances may arise where it is undesirable to send an ID Query
          to the instrument.  In those cases; set this control to "Skip Query"
          and this function will initialize the selected interface, without
          doing an ID Query.

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

          This control specifies if the instrument is to be reset to its
          power-on settings during the initialization procedure.
          
          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Don't Reset
          VI_ON  (1) - Reset Device (Default Value)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If you do not want the instrument reset. Set this control to
          "Don't Reset" while initializing the instrument.

      instrumentHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession (passed by reference)

          This control returns an Instrument Handle that is used in all
          subsequent function calls to differentiate between different sessions
          of this instrument driver.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Each time this function is invoked a Unique Session is opened.
          It is possible to have more than one session open for the same
          resource.

  hp8648a_readInstrData

      ViStatus hp8648a_readInstrData (ViSession instrumentHandle,
                                      ViInt16 numberBytesToRead, ViChar readBuffer[],
                                      ViInt32 *numBytesRead);

  Purpose

      This function reads data from the instrument's output buffer and returns
      it to the specified variable in memory.
      
      Notes:
      
      (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
      response to queries this function returns the data in string format.
      
      (2) If valid data is not available at the instrument's output buffer when
      this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function will
      not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled this function
      will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to reboot the computer to
      break out.

  Parameter List

      instrumentHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

          This control accepts the Instrument Handle returned by the Initialize
          function to select the desired instrument driver session.
          
          Default Value:  None

      numberBytesToRead

          Variable Type       ViInt16

          The number of bytes specified by this control should be greater than
          or equal to the number of bytes which are to be read from the
          instrument. If the actual number of bytes to be read is greater than
          the number this control specifies then multiple reads will be
          required to empty the instrument's output buffer.
          
          If the instrument's output buffer is not emptied the instrument may
          return invalid data when future reads are performed.
          
          Default Value:  50 (See NOTE 2)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If NO DATA is available at the instrument's output buffer when
          this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function
          will not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled,
          this function will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to
          reboot the computer.
          
          (2) If the number of bytes expected is greater than 50 the value of
          this control may be increased. If the actual number of bytes read is
          larger than the declared size of the read buffer a run-time error
          will be generated.
          

      readBuffer

          Variable Type       ViChar[]

          The incoming data from the instrument is placed into this variable.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
          response to queries this function returns the data in string format.
          
          (2) This function does not overwrite any old data left in the string
          variable from the last time the function was called. String data in
          LabWindows/CVI is terminated with an ASCII null(0x0) and string
          manipulation functions will only recognize data before the ASCII
          null.
          
          (3) The declared size of the string variable must be greater than the
          actual number of bytes read from the instrument if it is not a
          run-time error will be generated.
          

      numBytesRead

          Variable Type       ViInt32 (passed by reference)

          This variable contains the actual number of bytes read from the
          instrument. This is the value which is returned by the read function.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If the actual number of bytes read is less than the number of
          bytes specified in the Number Bytes To Read control then the output
          buffer has probably been emptied. If the read function fails and the
          number of bytes read is 0, the most probable cause for the failure is
          there was no data available at the instrument's output buffer.

  Return Value

          This control contains the status code returned by the function call.
